isthisatest
This project was developed as part of Week 19 of the Full Stack Developers Bootcamp. It focuses on implementing a comprehensive testing suite using Cypress, encompassing both component and end-to-end (E2E) tests. The primary goal is to ensure a reliable and smooth user experience while adhering to best practices in automated testing.
ðŸ§ª Project Overview
The isthisatest repository demonstrates the integration of Cypress into a full-stack application. By incorporating both component and E2E tests, the project ensures that individual components function correctly and that the application behaves as expected from the user's perspective.
ðŸš€ Features
